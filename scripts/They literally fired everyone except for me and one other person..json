I'm in. They did like 3 rounds of layoffs and now there are 6 of us. SIX. And four of them are the opening shift (6a-2p) and me and one other girl work 10a-6p. It gets SO busy after 2:00 and they literally don't give a fuck. It was actually just me by myself on Mon/Tues until a couple weeks ago they FINALLY put someone Mon-Fri with me. Today my coworker called out so it's been me on my own and I've literally answered 80 calls today and a bunch of chats/emails. I'm so stressed out that my chest hurts. I hate this place. I'm currently waiting to hear back from another company my friend works for that is 100x better than this place so hopefully I get the job. I would love to see everyone's reactions when I put in my notice, I'm literally the one person holding this entire department together. I need to get out!!","Rant over. Thank you for reading lmao"]}
