I can't let them know I am one.","About 30 minutes ago I'm on one of these regular calls, and I hear it... my #2 dumbest reason to escalate to a sup.","Ladies and gentlemen,  I kid you not, the woman I was on the phone with asked for a supervisor because I \"sound too professional and it's irritatin' \" she asked me why I was speaking like that no less than 3 times during the call. The last time she mentioned my speech she starts screaming at me to get her a sup because \"nobody talks like that\" and \"you tryin' ta sound smart, but I know you really stoopid\". ","What am I supposed to say to that? \"I'm sorry you find me to be too professional, I will happily try to sound like an idiot so you can feel superior to a lowly call center agent.\"","Edit: my mother always told me my mouth would get me in trouble one day."]}
