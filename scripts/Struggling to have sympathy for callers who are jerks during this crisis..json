And I want to speak to her manager.","Me: Ma'am, I don't think she purposely hung up on you. We're experiencing some technology issues due to the system being overloaded from everyone working at home due to everything that's going on.","Caller: NICE OF YOU TO MAKE EXCUSES.","Me: It's not an excuse, it's the reality of the situation, ma'am.","Caller: The reality of the situation? The reality of the situation is that people have AIDS and no one is helping them!! (?? I have NO idea where this came from, I could not make sense of this)","Me: ... what? I can connect you to ___'s line.","Caller: I want to speak to her manager. What is her name? Email? Title? Extension?","I provided the details and connected her to the person she was complaining about. I don't understand people who are jerks during this crisis, it's unreal to me. Especially because my org is a nonprofit that helps people for free. I wish we had further guidelines of, if you're a jerk we'll put a warning on your account and you wont be helped bc it's just ridiculous sometimes."]}
